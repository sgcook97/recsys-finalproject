# Project Requirements

## OVERVIEW
For the final project, you will design and test possible algorithms for a recommender system in a domain of your choosing. You need to be specific about the recommendation application you are designing for: how do you anticipate people using your recommender, and how does that influence your design, experiments, and analysis? You will then identify data you can use to prototype algorithms, carry out an experiment on algorithms intended for this specific application, and report the results. I encourage you to work on this project with a partner.

## The Learning Outcome
The learning outcome for this project is for you to be able to design an experiment and select algorithms that are suitable for a specific recommendation scenario, and describe the results of these experiments.

# TIMELINE AND MILESTONES
I am giving you the project now, so you can start to think about it and have it in mind during class, readings, and assignments, but I expect you to do the bulk of the work in April. The other assignments will be wrapped up by the end of March.
On March 29, we will use class to discuss your planned problems and how you might go about designing your experiments. You need to have decided on your project application by then (subject to revision based on class feedback).
On May 1, your final report is due. I am happy to give feedback on draft versions of the report, intermediate analyses, etc. throughout the month of April.

## APPLICATION AND DATA
For this project, you need to select a domain, a specific recommender application within that domain, and a data set that will enable you to test out algorithmic possibilities for your recommendation application.
Julian McAuleyâ€™s research group has a repository of data sets on a variety of topics that may be useful as a starting points, but you are not limited to this repository. 

# REQUIREMENTS
Your final submission for this project is a report describing your project and the results of your experiments. Pay particular attention to the appropriateness of your algorithmic, experimental, and interface decisions, and your justification for them. When grading, I will be paying attention to whether you have good reasons, clearly communicated, for the decisions that you make. 


## DATA SOURCES 

Following are some data sources that you may want to consider:
* [McAuley's Repo](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/datasets.html)

**Submission Format** 
1. Python code with markdown documentation, images saved in .jpg or .png format, and README.md as a project report OR
2. Jupyter notebook (.ipynb) that contains full markdown sections as listed above
